## Chapter 01. Introduction to Message Brokers and Kafka

### Message Brokers

> A message broker (also known as an integration broker or interface engine) is an intermediary computer program module
> that translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the
> receiver.

For example, a message broker may be used to manage a workload queue or message queue for multiple receivers, providing
reliable storage, guaranteed message delivery and perhaps transaction management.

**Key points:**

- Intermediary software (middleware) that passes messages between senders / producers and receivers / consumers
- May provide additional capabilities like:
    - Data Transformation
    - Validation
    - Queuing
    - Routing
- Full decoupling between senders and receivers

The following represent other examples of actions that might be handled by the broker:

- Route messages to one or more destinations
- Transform messages to an alternative representation
- Perform message aggregation, decomposing messages into multiple messages and sending them to their destination,
  then recomposing the responses into one message to return to the user
- Interact with an external repository to augment a message or store it
- Invoke web services to retrieve data
- Respond to events or errors
- Provide content and topic-based message routing using the publishâ€“subscribe pattern

Message brokers are generally based on one of two fundamental architectures:

- **hub-and-spoke**: a central server acts as the mechanism that provides integration services
- **message bus**: the message broker is a communication backbone or distributed service that acts on the bus

Additionally, a more scalable multi-hub approach can be used to integrate multiple brokers.

### Kafka

> Apache Kafka is a distributed event store and stream-processing platform.

It is an open-source system developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Java and Scala.

The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.

Kafka can connect to external systems (for data import/export) via `Kafka Connect`, and provides the `Kafka Streams`
libraries for stream processing applications.

Kafka uses a binary TCP-based protocol optimized for efficiency and relies on a **"message set"** abstraction that
naturally **groups** messages together to reduce the overhead of the network round-trip.

This leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks which allow Kafka to
turn a stream bursts of random messages writes into linear writes.
